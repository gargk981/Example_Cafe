    <h1>Recipes - World's Best Scrambled Eggs</h1>
    <p>I adopted this recipe from a book called Sydney Food by Bill Granger. Ever since tasting these eggs on my 1<sup>st</sup> visit to Bill's restaurant in Kings Cross,
      Sydney. I have been after the recipe I have since transformed it into what i really believe are the best scrambled eggs i have ever tasted.</p>
    <p>This recipe is what I call a "very special breakfast", just look at the ingredients to see why it has to be tasted to be believed.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <p>The following ingredients make one serving:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>2 eggs</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon of butter(10g)</li>
      <li>1/3 cup of cream(2 3/4 flounces)</li>
      <li>A pinch of salt</li>
      <li>Freshly miled black pepper</li>
      <li>3 fresh chives(chopped)</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Whisk eggs, cream, and salt in a bowl</li>
      <li>Melt the butter in a nonstick pan over a high heat(taking care not to burn the butter).</li>
      <li>Pour egg mixture into pan and wait until it starts setting around the edge of the pan(around 20 seconds).</li>
      <li>Using a wooden spatula, bring the mixture into the center as if it were an omelet and let it cook for another 20 seconds.</li>
      <li>Foid contents in again, leave for 20 seconds, and repeat until the eggs are only just done.</li>
      <li>Grind a light sprinkling of freshly miled pepper over the eggs and blend in some chopped fresh chives.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>You should only make a <b>maximum</b> of two servings per frying pan.</p>
